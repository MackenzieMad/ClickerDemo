<h2>About this Project</h2>
<p>This is a small project I started in my free time to learn how to use the WPF UI Framework. I have previous experience with WinForms, and want to expand my knowledge on making desktop applicaitons through Microsoft's ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Why this would interest future employers</h2>
<p>I believe that working with and learning new technologies is important for personal and professional growth. I want to learn more about Microsoft's design principles and create applications that are as fun to use as they are to create.</p>
